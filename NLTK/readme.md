# Natural Language ToolKit

NLTK, or Natural Language Toolkit, is a Python package that you can use for NLP. The NLTK (Natural Language Toolkit) is a popular Python library used for working with human language data, also known as natural language processing (NLP). It provides various tools and resources for tasks such as tokenization, stemming, tagging, parsing, and more. 

**Some key features of NLTK include**
* **Tokenization:** NLTK can break down text into individual words or sentences, which is a common preprocessing step in NLP tasks.
* **Stemming and Lemmatization:**  These processes involve reducing words to their base or root forms. Stemming is a more aggressive approach, while lemmatization considers the context and grammatical structure of words.
* **Part-of-Speech Tagging:** NLTK can assign parts of speech (e.g., noun, verb, adjective) to each word in a sentence, which is useful for understanding the grammatical structure of text.
* **Chunking and Parsing:** The library can be used to analyze sentence structure and extract meaningful phrases from text.
* **Sentiment Analysis:** NLTK includes tools for determining the sentiment or emotional tone of a given piece of text.
* **Named Entity Recognition (NER):** NLTK can identify and classify named entities like names, locations, dates, etc., within a text.
* **Corpora and Resources:** NLTK provides a wide range of language resources and corpora that can be used for training and testing NLP models.
* **Machine Learning:** While NLTK provides tools for various linguistic tasks, it's also commonly used alongside machine learning libraries like scikit-learn for more advanced NLP tasks, such as text classification or language generation.
